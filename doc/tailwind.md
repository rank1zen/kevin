# Tailwind Theme Variables

Tailwind theme variables are based on [Flowbite
documentation](https://flowbite.com/docs/customize/variables/).

- `color-brand-{level}-{accent}`: one or more brand colors to represent the
  brand

- `color-neutral-{level}-{accent}`: neutral colors to represent the gray colors

- `color-fg-{type}-{level}-{accent}`: foreground colors to represent the text
  colors

- `color-{status}-{accent}`: status colors to represent the different states
  (eg. warning, success etc.)

The `level` placeholder is either blank or it can be `primary`, `secondary`,
`tertiary`, `quaternary` which are used to represent the different levels of the
color based on importance.

The `accent` placeholder is either blank or it can be `soft`, `subtle`,
`medium`, `strong` which are used to represent the different levels of the color
based on the amount of color.

The `type` placeholder is usually the main color type such as `brand`,
`neutral`, `warning`, etc.
